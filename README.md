# Password-Generator

## Description

I added functionality to an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript to dynamically render the password to the screen. The user has options to include special characters, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and numerical values.
